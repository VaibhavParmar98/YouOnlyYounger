                  Katieâ€™s career in healthcare began in 2007 as an RN in the
                  Emergency Department. She gained a wealth of knowledge,
                  skills, and experience quickly and loved the fast pace. After 5
                  years in that intense setting, she desired to create more
                  personal and ongoing relationships with her patients. In 2012
                  she earned her Master of Science in Nursing degree and became
                  a Family Nurse Practitioner. For 10 years Katie cared for
                  patients and their families in the retail health and
                  traditional family medicine settings before being divinely led
                  to You Only Younger in 2022. Here she has discovered the
                  perfect blend of traditional medicine, holistic medicine,
                  complementary therapies, and lifestyle interventions. She has
                  been an integral part of the development of our Weight Loss
                  Program.

                  Her proven success as a leader has earned her a promotion to
